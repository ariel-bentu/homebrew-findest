    <<~EOS
      Run `findest` once to install Findest.app (into /Applications, or
      ~/Applications if that isn't writable) and open it. After
      `brew upgrade findest`, run `findest` again to update the app.

      `findest <folder>` opens a folder. Cloud drives and the Trash need
      Full Disk Access: System Settings > Privacy & Security.
